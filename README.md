# Service Fabric Mesh Samples

This repository contains samples that showcase what you can do with Service Fabric Mesh Applications.

For more details about Service Fabric Mesh public preview in Azure, refer to this blog post - https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/blog/azure-service-fabric-mesh-is-now-in-public-preview/

## Structure of this repo

This repository has two main folders:

- **src** contains source code samples. Some of these are built using the [Visual Studio Tools for Mesh](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/service-fabric-mesh/service-fabric-mesh-howto-setup-developer-environment-sdk). Use these samples if you want to build the code from source, publish container images and deploy the app to Mesh.

- **templates** contains samples with ARM templates ready to deploy to Azure Mesh. Use these templates if you want to deploy an application using existing container images and deployment templates

Both folders contain instructions on how to work with the samples.
